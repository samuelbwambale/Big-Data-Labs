QUESTION 1.
Write an in-mapper combiner algorithm modifying Co-occurrence Matrix (pairs approach) algorithm.

Class Mapper
    method initialize()
        H = new AssociativeArray()

    method map(docid a, doc d)
        for all term u in  record r do
            for all term v in window(u) do
                Pair p = (u,v)
                if p is null
                    H{p} = 1
                else
                    H{p} = H{p} + 1

    method close()
        for all term p in H do
            Emit(p,H{p})


//Reducer Class Pseudo Code Using Pair Approach
Class Reducer
    method reduce(Pair(u,v), Integer[j1,j2...........jn])
        sum = 0
        for all term j in [j1,j2...........jn] do
            sum = sum + j
        Emit((u,v),sum)
