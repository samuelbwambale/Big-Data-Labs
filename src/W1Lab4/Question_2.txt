QUESTION 2.
Write an in-mapper combiner algorithm modifying Co-occurrence Matrix (stripe approach) algorithm.

Class Mapper
    method initialize()
        S = new AssociativeArray()

    method map(docid a, doc d)
        for all term u in record r do
            H = new AssociativeArray()
            for all term v in window(u) do
                H{v} = H{v} + 1
            if S{u} is null
                S{u} = H
            else
                S{u} = S{u} + H

    method close()
        for all term u in S do
            Emit(u, S{u})


Class Reducer
    method reduce(term u, AssociativeArray[H1,H2.........Hn])
        S = new AssociativeArray()
        for all stripe H in [H1,H2.........Hn] do
            T = T + H
        Emit(u, T)
